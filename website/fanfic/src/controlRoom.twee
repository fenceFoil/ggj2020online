:: controls

You enter the control room and are comforted by the wood panelling and the brass piping running up and down the walls. The Dataroach, your favorite child, is using your castle as a prototype for a new tank design, but when he asked the townspeople for fuel they refused him, and he burned the town!

Now it's up to you to produce enough fuel to get his tanks back on the road and out of the sand pits they fell into.

Your castle on a hill is also an abondoned waffle iron.

:: impeach

$deaths roaches starve. Uh oh!

Unfortunately for you, the Dataroach returns just now. Hearing your people protest your extreme mismanagement, he leverages super-secret mahogany tanks to storm your headquarters! You stand no chance; the Dataroach has you in his grasp now. Let's see how he treats you when you are detained…

Following his coup, the Dataroach disassembled your home and redecorated it. He removed a large monitor, and on it he projected an image of a screen on the battlefield. On that screen he had carved the following word: "WERE." A light for the victors flashes in his eyes as he reads them: "YOU WILL NOT ENTER PLS!"

🐜 YOU HAVE DIED (of shame). 🐜
